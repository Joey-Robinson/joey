      <h1>Goals</h1>
      <p>
        My current goals are pretty straightforward: I want to make things I think are amazing and work with an awesome team who has a similar mindset as I do.
        I also want to know several programming languages, so I can make anything in any language I want :D.

      <h1>Interests</h1>
      <p>I have varying interests, some of which include watching movies. From Bladerunner to a Silent Voice, I enjoy a great movies
        I also enjoy writing code and learning about code to write even more code! Speaking of reading, I love a good fatnasy book. My favorite is
        The Name Of The Wind, written by Patrick Rothfuss. I absolutely love talking about coding and the endless possibilities it can bring. From
        the future potiential of CSS Grid, to the world domination that JavaScript has and will maintain.

      <p>
        Generally I'm pretty laxed. I like to be engaging at times but like most people, I also enjoy my own personal alone time to reflect. 
        Dogs & Cats are equal in my book, I like them both the same amount.

      <h1>The Past</h1>
      <p>
        I think people are often scared to talk about their past. Airing their dirty laundry, so to speak. I find that all my prior experiences in life
        both negative and positive have been incredible learning experiences. I generally try to use every random encounter or event in my life to grow as a 
        person. 
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Through my life, I've had opportunities to grow and become more knowledgeable through my years. I can only hope that as I begin my journey as a 
        professional web-developer, I continue to grow. :D

    <h1>The Future</h1>
      <p>
        When I started this journey, I was very intimidated by the amount of information that I had to process. It was (and still is sometimes)
        overwhelming. With that said, I now feel comfortable with what I know and want to continue to learn about coding and learn about coding technologies.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        I could see myself, years down the road, making amazing websites and tools for people to use and enjoy. I genuinely am looking forward to growing not only
        as a Web-Developer, but a person as well. I feel like I've stumbled across something in life I can finally enjoy.
