      <h1>Interests</h1>
      <p>I have varying interests, some of which include watching movies. From Bladerunner to a Silent Voice, I enjoy a great movies
        I also enjoy writing code and learning about code to write even more code! Speaking of reading, I love a good fatnasy book. My favorite is
        The Name Of The Wind, written by Patrick Rothfuss. I absolutely love talking about coding and the endless possibilities it can bring. From
        the future potiential of CSS Grid, to the world domination that JavaScript has and will maintain.

        Generally I'm pretty laxed. I like to be engaging at times but like most people, I also enjoy my own personal alone time to reflect. 
        Dogs & Cats are equal in my book, I like them both the same amount.

      <h1>The Future</h1>
      <p>
        When I started this journey, I was very intimidated by the amount of information that I had to process. It was (and still is sometimes)
        overwhelming. With that said, I now feel comfortable with what I know and want to continue to learn about coding and learn about coding technologies.

        I could see myself, years down the road, making amazing websites and tools for people to use and enjoy. I genuinely am looking forward to growing not only
        as a Web-Developer, but a person as well. I feel like I've stumbled across something in life I can finally enjoy.
