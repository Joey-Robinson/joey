        I also enjoy writing code and learning about code to write even more code! Speaking of reading, I love a good fatnasy book. My favorite is
        The Name Of The Wind, written by Patrick Rothfuss. I absolutely love talking about coding and the endless possibilities it can bring. From
        the future potiential of CSS Grid, to the world domination that JavaScript has and will maintain.

        Generally I'm pretty laxed. I like to be engaging at times but like most people, I also enjoy my own personal alone time to reflect. 
        Dogs & Cats are equal in my book, I like them both the same amount.
